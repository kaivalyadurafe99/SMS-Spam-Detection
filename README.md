# SMS-Spam-Detection
. The main objective is to detect whether the sms are spam or not.

. Further the model implementation starts with the NLP text preprocessing techniques using NLTK library.

. Visualized some insights using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python.

. Used different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Naive Bayes to detect the sms spam or not spam.

. Among all these algorithms the Logistic Regression algorithm perform well on training data which gives the best accuracy and precision score.

. Acheived the model accuracy of 97.87%.
